This is a pretty bare-bones starter template for a Next.js application, using `styled-components` for styling.

## Setup

Clone the repository.

`$ git clone https://github.com/evanwinter/starter-next my-next-app`

Navigate to the app folder.

`$ cd my-next-app`

Install the dependencies.

`$ npm install`

Run the app locally.

`$ npm run dev`

Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000, and you should see the app running.
